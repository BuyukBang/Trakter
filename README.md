First of all, I'd like to thank everyone contributing Flexget which makes Trakter be possible!

Trakter is a Flexget project to create Trakt.tv lists automatically using IMDB.com advanced search feature. Trakter also creates "Releases" and "No Releases" lists by searching Rarbg and The Pirate Bay.

To run Trakter follow these steps:

1- Trakter requires Flexget and Microsoft Powershell installed and ready on your system. Checkout https://flexget.com for details about Flexget.
2- Edit variables.yml file and modify parameters.
3- Modify Trakter.ps1 file and delete blocks if you don't want Trakter creates some of the lists. [Optional Step]
4- Sign In your Trakt account and create lists with these names: "Releases", "No Releases", "2021 Releases", "2021 No Releases", "2020 Releases", "2020 No Releases", "2019 Releases", "2019 No Releases", "2019 Releases", "2019 No Releases", "2018 Releases", "2018 No Releases", "2017 Releases", "2017 No Releases", "2016 Releases", "2016 No Releases", "2015 Releases", "2015 No Releases", "Turkish Releases", "Turkish No Releases", "Horror Releases", "Horror No Releases"
5- Then click Trakter.bat and check output logs if everything working.
6- Now you can check your Trakter list :)
