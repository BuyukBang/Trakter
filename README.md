First of all, I'd like to thank everyone contributing Flexget which makes Trakter be possible!

Trakter is a Flexget project to create Trakt.tv lists automatically using IMDB.com advanced search feature.
You can check my lists generated by Trakter here: https://trakt.tv/users/buyukbang/lists

To run Trakter follow these steps:

1- Trakter requires Flexget and Microsoft Powershell installed and ready on your system. Checkout https://flexget.com for details about Flexget.
2- Edit variables.yml file and modify parameters.
3- Modify Trakter.ps1 file and delete blocks if you don't want Trakter creates some of the lists. [Optional Step]
4- Sign In your Trakt account and create lists with the names present in Trakter.ps1.
5- Then click Trakter.bat and check output logs if everything working.
6- Now you can check your Trakter list :)
